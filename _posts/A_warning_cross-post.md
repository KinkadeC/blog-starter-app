You'll never reach measurable viewership posting on your own site. So post on Twitter, facebook, Medium, or whatever site is appropriate for your content. Just make sure you link back to your site, because that's the only spot on the internet you can control. All of those large sites will be around for the forseeable future, but who knows how easy it'll be to pull your data off there at some point. Facebook is a couple of clicks, Twitter too, but better safe than sorry. 



**Post in parallel. If not to try and capture viewers on your site, at least do it for simple data safety.**
