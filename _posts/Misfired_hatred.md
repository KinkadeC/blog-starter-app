Every time I see a video of a large foreign city, bustling with people and cars, I wonder what they think about us. 

### Who is 'us'?

Well I really meant people not in their country. Or maybe people not even in their city if their sphere is small enough. 

I know that they do think of 'us', but not as a collection of individuals, but rather as a group overall. That right there is the problem. When you star grouping people and thinking about them as a whole unit, they stop being people and become something...less.

### Flip your perspective

That's how we view all people outside of our immediate sphere. It's not inherently wrong, but as with most beliefs, how that informs your decision-making is what matters. To see why, flip this perspective. The same way you judge them as a group, they judge you. Look at all of the information left on the table now. Our country can't continuously be defined by the 51-49 split that seems to be a constant in every major decision.
